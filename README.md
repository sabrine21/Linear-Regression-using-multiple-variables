# Home Price Prediction using Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
This project demonstrates how to use linear regression with multiple variables to predict the price of a home. 
The data used in this project is a fictional dataset created for educational purposes. However, the techniques 
and methods demonstrated in this project can be applied to real-world datasets.

# Prerequisites
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x installed
Jupyter Notebook installed
The following Python packages installed: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn

# Getting Started
To get started, download or clone the project repository to your local machine. 
Then, open the Linear regression using multiple variables.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about homes, such as the number of bedrooms, the age,and the area. 
It also contains the price of each home.

# Linear Regression with Multiple Variables
Linear regression with multiple variables is a method for predicting a numerical value based on several input variables. 
In this project, we will use linear regression with multiple variables to predict the price of a home based on its characteristics.

The steps we will follow in this project are:

Load the dataset
Explore the dataset
Prepare the data for training
Train the model
Make predictions

# Conclusion
In this project, we have demonstrated how to use linear regression with multiple variables to predict the price of a home. 
We have shown how to use the model to make predictions.

This project is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn about linear regression with multiple variables 
and how it can be used to predict the price of a home.
